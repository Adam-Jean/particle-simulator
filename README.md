# ðŸŒŒ Interactive Particle Simulator

A interactive particle simulation built with Python and Pygame where particles interact with cursor movement through simulated gravitational forces, creating dynamic visual patterns.

## âœ¨ Features

Velocity and gravitational forces are calculated with [Newton's law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation)\

* **Cursor-based Gravity**: Particles are attracted (or repelled) by the cursor, creating fluid and responsive patterns
* **Dynamic Color Changes**: Particles shift colors based on their velocity, providing visual feedback of their movement


### Prerequisites

* Python 3
* Pygame


## ðŸŽ® How to Use

* Move your cursor around the screen to attract particles
* Press ESC to exit the simulation
